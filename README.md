# Endless Mobile

This is a fork of [endless-sky](https://endless-sky.github.io/) that will attempt to add android support, as well as touchscreen and user interface updates that should make it useful for other platforms as well.

The android branch will be the main branch that developement takes place against, and the master branch will be the lastest endless-sky branch that the master branch is based on.
